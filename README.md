# PINNs
Physics Informed Neural Network used NN metodologies to solve ODE's and PDE's physics problems. 
The PINNs curse began with interpolation with NN to understand how can we use this metodology to aproximate functions. Then we study traditional numerical methods to put head to head with the PINNs metodology. And finaly we are working with PINNs struture and metodology.
